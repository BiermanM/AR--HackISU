## Inspiration
We wanted to use the Tango development kit and Unity.

## What it does
This application on a Tango dev kit will give the user the ability to place a kitten anywhere in the room.

## How we built it
We used unity connected to some Tango libraries that let us use the Tango sensors.

## Challenges we ran into
It crashes constantly
The inventory system stopped working halfway through
The project got corrupted with 2 hours to go
The engine kept asking us to update despite using the latest version
Since its a dev kit there is little online to find help debugging
The internet was really slow so we had issues sharing it between team members.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
It makes a kitty cat appear in a room and figured out how to add a button.

## What we learned
None of us had tried AR before, or used the Tango development kit.

## What's next for KittyKat
Trying to make more than just the cat work.

## Built With
`Unity` `C#` `Google Tango`
